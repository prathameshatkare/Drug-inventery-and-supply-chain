## About the Project

The **Drug Inventory and Supply Chain Tracking System** is designed to streamline the management, tracking, and distribution of drugs and pharmaceuticals. This system enhances transparency, reduces errors, and helps ensure drugs are available to those who need them. It serves as a centralized platform to manage inventory, track shipments, and monitor supply chains.

## Features

- **Real-Time Inventory Management**: Monitor drug availability and stock levels.
- **Supply Chain Tracking**: Track shipments from manufacturers to distributors and retail points.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Automated alerts for low stock, shipment delays, and expiration warnings.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Generate reports on inventory, sales, and distribution patterns.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin, distributor, and retailer roles to control access and permissions.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Other**: REST APIs for data handling

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- MySQL

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Drug-Inventory-Tracking-System.git
   cd Drug-Inventory-Tracking-System
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
